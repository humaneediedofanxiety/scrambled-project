                    <p>Oh damnn how did you find this hidden text? are you some kind of genius, prodigy. I had hidden it so well and ofcourse I made sure that there was no arrows pointing to a very obvious looking letter. Okay whatever. Don't think I made this site for you. Nawww Dawgg I was just bored and I hadn't designed anything good for a while I could've made a better design if I didn't procrastiante ughhhh. And by the way, you sure that you gon meet? Nevermind our bond won't last long considering our differences I think but whatever I'll leave that stuff for later. For now rate my design.  <br><br><i><span id="close">Click Here to Close</span></i></p> </div>
